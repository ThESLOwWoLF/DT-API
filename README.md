# Event Management API

## About This Project
This is my first REST API project, developed as part of my journey learning backend development. The API manages events, allowing users to create, read, update, and delete event information. While building this, I learned about REST principles, MongoDB, Express.js, and API development best practices.

## Learning Journey
As a beginner in backend development, I started this project to gain hands-on experience. Here's what I learned:

- Setting up a Node.js server with Express.js
- Working with MongoDB as a database
- Implementing REST API endpoints
- Handling HTTP requests and responses
- Data validation and error handling
- Using environment variables for configuration
- Testing APIs using REST Client

## Technologies Used
- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB
- Mongoose
- REST Client (for testing)


## Future Improvements
As I continue learning, I plan to:
- Add user authentication
- Implement input validation
- Add more detailed error handling
- Create automated tests
- Improve documentation
- Add file upload functionality

## Acknowledgments
- YouTube tutorials that helped me learn
- Stack Overflow community
- AI tools that assisted me in debugging but failed
